## IntentionÂ ðŸ’¡

When visually impaired people shop at a mart, they have an inconvenience of not knowing what is in front of them.

Even if a visually impaired person picks up an item and checks the Braille notation, he or she cannot choose a product according to his or her preference because Braille notation does not even know the brand or product name or type.

Wave-Show-Card is designed to help visually impaired people shop comfortably.

## FeaturesÂ ðŸš€

Wave-Show-Card is a service that helps visually impaired people listen to the show card. It uses the sound-wave communication libraryÂ `Euphony` . It provides the following features:

(Visually Impaired)

- When a visually impaired person clicks the web show card, the show card transmits sound waves.
- When a visually impaired person brings the app near the show card, the app receives the sound waves of the show card, interprets the content, and plays it as a sound.

(Clerk)

- The clerk can save and modify the contents of the show card using a web socket.
